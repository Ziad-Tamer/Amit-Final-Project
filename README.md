🧠 Arabic Sentence Autocorrector

This project is an Arabic sentence autocorrect system. It uses a trained LSTM model to predict and correct spelling errors in short Arabic text inputs.
The application includes a user-friendly GUI built with Tkinter.

🚀 Features

- ✅ Preprocessing and tokenization of Arabic text
- ✅ LSTM-based sequence model for prediction
- ✅ Model training with Keras and validation checkpoints
- ✅ Simple desktop GUI using Python's Tkinter library
- ✅ UTF-8 and right-to-left Arabic text handling

🖥️ How It Works

1. Preprocessing: Arabic input is normalized and tokenized.
2. Prediction: A trained LSTM model processes the input and generates corrected text.
3. GUI: The user enters a sentence and sees the corrected output instantly.

📊 Dataset

The model was trained using the BRAD (Basic Resource for Arabic Dialects) dataset:
